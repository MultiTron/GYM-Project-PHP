My sites main goal is to show gym exercises. The exercises are deviden into muscle group and can be choosen by groups. 
When a user is logged he has the ability to add a workout to his library and that way to see all the exercises that he likes.
A video using the site is added in the files.

The site is written in php the database is made in MySql. I used WAMP server while compiling the site, a mysql file will be added for creating the database.
